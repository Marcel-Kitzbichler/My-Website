            <h2>How i develop Film</h2>
            I have been develpoing film at home for quite some time now and it turned out to be easier than i would have thought before starting to do it,
            the main reason why i have started to develop black and white film myself is because here in austria it is really expensive to get it done
            at a local shop. I have started out with just watching some videos on youtube and buying a starter set like 
            <a href="https://www.fotoimpex.de/shop/analog-startsets/fotoimpex-starter-set-film.html?cache=1699896288" class="articleLink">this one</a>.
            I developed my first roll of film also just following a youtube video by the youtuber analog resurgence and it turned out pretty good.
            The only thing i think no one really tells you is a way to easily load film into the developing tank. Most people just open the film canister and try 
            to fiddle it into the reel in the dark. I just don't fully rewind the film into the canister when rewinding it with my camera you can feel it getting 
            easier just before the leader gets back into the canister then i stop. After getting the film out of the camera i cut the leader off and pull out just
            a little bit of film to get it started into the reel. Only then i turn off the lights and wind the whole film into the reel and close the tank. 
            You just need to be careful to not pull out too much film in the light because it will get exposed.
