            <h2>3D printed watch</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working on the second version of a diy 3d printed watch. It is based on a Miyota 8n24 Movement.The case back is screwed on and the
                mineral watch glass is inserted while printing. I plan on making the back also transparent, but i wan't to get the first prototype done first
                and then worry about some cosmetic changes. Down below you can see a render of the case.
