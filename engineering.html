            <h2>Bike Powermeter</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working on a diy bike powermeter. 
                It is based on strain gauges and a HX711 ADC. 
                The data is then processed by an microcontroller and the 
                sent to any standard bike computer via Bluetooth.
                The powermeter is currently in the testing phase but the 
                first results are promising. You can find more information
                about the project in the <a href="https://github.com/Marcel-Kitzbichler/Bike-Powermeter" class="articleLink">Github repository</a>.
                There is also some sample data collected from a ride down below.
                Both the power and the cadence are collected from the powermeter.
                Cadence is measured by a gyroscope.

            <h2>3D printed watch</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working on the second version of a diy 3D printed watch. It is based on a Miyota 8n24 Movement.The case back is screwed on and the
                mineral watch glass is inserted while printing. I plan on making the back also transparent, but i want to get the first prototype done first
                and then worry about some cosmetic changes. Down below you can see a render of the case.

            <h2>Very simple "Database"</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently have a small sideproject where i try to make a very simple way to store and retrieve data from a 
                json file using a rest api. I wouldn't recommend using it for anything serious, but it is a fun way to learn about using rest apis
                and reading and writing to json files in Node JS. You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/Marcel-Kitzbichler/json-server"

            <h2>Diy Drone</h2>
            <p>
                I just started to build a small 3 inch sub 250g drone. It will probably be a pusher style drone and the frame will be fully 3D printed. I currently have only built
                up the frame and still wait for the elctronics to arrive from china. The brain of my drone will be a speedybee F405 mini. But there will be more information about
                it here once it is finished and flying.
