            <h2>3D printed watch</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working on the second version of a diy 3D printed watch. It is based on a Miyota 8n24 Movement.The case back is screwed on and the
                mineral watch glass is inserted while printing. I plan on making the back also transparent, but i want to get the first prototype done first
                and then worry about some cosmetic changes. Down below you can see a render of the case.

            <h2>Very simple "Database"</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently have a small sideproject where i try to make a very simple way to store and retrieve data from a 
                json file using a rest api. I wouldn't recommend using it for anything serious, but it is a fun way to learn about using rest apis
                and reading and writing to json files in Node JS. You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/Marcel-Kitzbichler/json-server"
